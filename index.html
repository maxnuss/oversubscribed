			<h1>Our Story</h1>
			<div class="authors-grid">
				<div>
					<p>We met in Detroit in 2013, as early members of Venture for America. By 2014, we had each started our own companies. As first-time founders, we faced the new challenge of fundraising. At first, we were terrible at it. Which is no surprise—fundraising is really hard!</p>
					<p>Although both of our companies eventually failed, we ended up becoming pretty good at early-stage fundraising along the way, raising a combined $5M from all sorts of investors: famous ones like Khosla Ventures, SV Angel, and Y Combinator, but also tons of smaller angels and VCs you’ve probably never heard of.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>Over the years, as other founders started coming to us for fundraising advice, we realized that there wasn’t a good source for the kind of guidance we’d have wanted to see when we were raising our companies’ first rounds.</p>
					<p>And lots of the best advice out there came from VCs (who weren&rsquo;t exactly neutral parties) or was written for people who already had connections. There wasn’t much out there that felt targeted towards typical first-time founders like us.</p>
					<p>This book is the guide we wish we’d had when we were first starting out.</p>
